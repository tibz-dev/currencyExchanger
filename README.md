The Currency Exchanger website is a web application that allows users to exchange currency rates between two currencies. Here's an overview of how it is made and the languages used:

1. **Frontend**: The frontend of the Currency Exchanger website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used for structuring the webpage, CSS for styling it, and JavaScript for adding interactivity.

2. **Backend**: The backend of the website is built using C# and ASP.NET. C# is a programming language used for backend development, and ASP.NET is a web framework for building web applications with C#. In this case, ASP.NET Web Forms are used to handle user interactions and server-side processing.

3. **API Integration**: The website integrates with the Alpha Vantage API to retrieve currency exchange rate data. The API allows the website to fetch real-time exchange rate information for various currency pairs.

4. **User Interface**: The website's user interface includes input fields for users to enter the currency codes they want to exchange, a button to trigger the exchange rate lookup, and a section to display the exchange rate information once retrieved.

5. **Functionality**: When a user enters the currency codes and clicks the "Search" button, the website makes an HTTP request to the Alpha Vantage API with the entered currency codes. The API responds with the exchange rate information, which is then displayed on the website.

Overall, the Currency Exchanger website is a combination of frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for the user interface, and backend technologies (C#, ASP.NET) for server-side processing and API integration, allowing users to easily check currency exchange rates.
